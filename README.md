# Wolfram-hypergraphs
In this Repository I will try to create Wolfram Hypergraphs, and document my path into make one of those attonishing graphs that almost look 3D
# Libraries
We will use these libraries in order to make the graphics.
```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
The usage of ``` matplotlib ``` integrates with  ``` networkx ```, to draw nodes on a 2 dimensional plane and allows customization of the graph layout, colors, sizes and labels.

I will be updating for the errors that I encounter and how to solve them.
